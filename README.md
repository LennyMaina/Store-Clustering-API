# Store-Clustering-API
An end-to-end unsupervised learning pipeline that categorizes stores using K-Means clustering. This project includes data preprocessing, model serialization with Joblib, and a FastAPI production wrapper. It transforms raw marketing and sales data into actionable segments like "High Value" and "Emerging" stores through a real-time API.
